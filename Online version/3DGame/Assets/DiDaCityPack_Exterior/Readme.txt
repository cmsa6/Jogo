Hello! First of all, we are very thankfull for your support!

Most assets share the same material, a texture atlas. That texture has 3 versions: color, metallic and roughness.
Some exceptions of assets that don't use these materials are objects like street ads where they need their own specific texture that is provided.
We also included descriptive images to help you visualize the whole content

Why is the city not present in the pack?

	First, all those environments serve as just an example of what you can achieve with this asset pack. Our main goal was to do an asset pack, not an environment.
	Second, the city was built in Blender files so you wouldn't be able to do anything with them, since they were not built in game-engines.
	Third, and unfortunately, the files where the city was built were lost and we were not able to recover them.

	We hope you understand.
